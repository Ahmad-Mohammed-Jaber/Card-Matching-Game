# 🃏 Card Matching Game (React)

A simple card matching (memory) game built with React. Flip two cards at a time—if they match, they stay revealed. Match all pairs to win.

Features include card duplication and random shuffling, click-to-flip interaction, match detection logic, and a clean, beginner-friendly UI. This project is intended as a learning exercise for core React concepts such as state management, effects, and component-based design.

The game starts with a shuffled deck containing pairs of cards. Clicking a card reveals it. When two cards are revealed, the game checks for a match. Matching cards remain visible, while non-matching cards flip back after a short delay. The game ends when all pairs are matched.

The project is built using React, and an npm component for card flipping and delays.
